# facemasks
3D printed models for facemasks during the time of covid19.

STL models for two different visors to be used with faceshields are provided.  Like some of the other faceshield models available, this require two additional items:
1. An elastic band that connects the two ends around your head.
2. Transparent plastic that conencts to the visor and acts as the shield.

A 3-hole puncher is required to make holds in the plastic, such that it can connect to the shield.  Some tape will keep the shield in place.

The two models have similar frames, but use different amounts of plastic and require different print time.

The main model has a splatter cover included.  It requires around 11.6cm^3 of filament.
The second model does not have the splatter cover.  It requires 5.8cm^3 of filament, and prints at around half the time.
